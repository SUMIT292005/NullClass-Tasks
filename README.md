Age Detection Using CNN

Overview

This project involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the age of individuals based on the IMDB-WIKI dataset. The task was completed in Google Colab with a focus on fine-tuning a pre-trained ResNet model for better accuracy.

Key Features:

1.Dataset: A subset of 6000 images from the IMDB-WIKI dataset.

2.Model: Fine-tuned ResNet model.

3.Performance: Achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.30 on the test set and 8.85 on the validation set.

4.Tools: Google Colab for training and evaluation.

Usage:

1.Clone the repository:

    git clone <repository_url>

2.Open the project in Google Colab.

3.Run the provided Jupyter Notebook file (Task1.ipynb).

4.Adjust parameters as needed to experiment with the model.

Results:

The model provides age predictions with reasonable accuracy and is optimized for resource-constrained environments.
